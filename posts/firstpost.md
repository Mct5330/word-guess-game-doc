## Background

For our final Project in IST402, our team decided to create a word-guessing-game. This would be a web-based word game allowing users to guess a random five-letter word. Each user would be given 5-6 attempts to guess the word. For each guess, a letter is marked as either green, yellow, or gray: Green indicates that the letter is correct, and yellow indicates that it is in the answer but not in the correct position. In contrast, gray indicates it is not in the correct position answer. [Project](https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues/963)
